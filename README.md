# Routing Foundation Model (RFM)

Routing Foundation Model (RFM) is a unified neural optimization framework
for large-scale routing and mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs).

This repository contains:

- The `rfm` Python package with core model components.
- Example experiment scripts for synthetic routing benchmarks.
- A LaTeX monograph in `paper/` describing the RFM framework.
